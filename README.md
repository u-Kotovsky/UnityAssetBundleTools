# UnityAssetBundleTools
I made this quick package just so I can quickly test some asset bundles I use.

> [!TIP]
> You can get latest release from [here](https://github.com/u-Kotovsky/UnityAssetBundleTools/releases)
> or download code, both should work just fine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I use it in Unity `2022.3.22f1` so I don't know how it'll work on other versions.

## How to use

### How to load an asset into scene
Go to `Tools/Kotovsky Unity Asset Bundle Tools/Editor/Load Asset From AssetBundle`
and select your AssetBundle file.

### How to load a scene
> [!WARNING]
> It works only in playmode.

Go to `Tools/Kotovsky Unity Asset Bundle Tools/Runtime/Load Scene From AssetBundle`
and select your AssetBundle file.
